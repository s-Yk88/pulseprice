PULSE PRICES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Summary:

Pulses have been considered an environmentally-friendly and inexpensive alternative to commodities like meat, ideal in helping to combat food insecurity. The FFPI suggests that effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused dramatic price surges in all food groups, including pulses, that threaten our ability to feed the growing global population. But is it really just the impacts of the pandemic that threatens this ability?

In order to answer the ultimate question of: “What could have happened to the prices of pulses if the pandemic did not happen?”, I wanted to focus on the price forecasts of this food group in countries most susceptible to food insecurity as determined by the World Food Programme (WFP). I examine food price data from the WFP to create time series forecasts via gradient boosting of what could have happened to the prices of select pulses in the developing world if the pandemic had not occurred.
